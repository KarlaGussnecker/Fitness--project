I created this project to try out and play around with the "React Router" library from React. It is indeed easy to work with, easy to link pages within a website and since it uses client side routing, it's very fast when switching between pages since it's not making requests from any server. You can read all the documentation about "React Router" [here](https://reactrouter.com/en/main). I decided to use their most common components BrowserRouter and the Link element.

The landing page consists of a background video, an animated button and the footer. After pressing the button the user is taken on to the home page where you have a navbar with three elements and some dummy text. I've split the three elements from the navigation bar in to their own components and by clicking them they take you to a different page each.

Firstly in the Sign Up area I've made a form using TypeForm and pasted it in my project as a Widget component so it's fully functional but since I only got the free version from their website the clicks are limited.

The About section just has some dummy text and in the FAQ section I've installed a React package that I've found online called react-FAQ-component that basically generates a simple "frequently asked questions" section. More information on how to use it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-faq-component).

The idea of creating a Error page came from reading the React Router documentation where it mentions something similar and I of course decided to make a slightly funnier version. So if there is a misspelling in the url this error page will pop up, but no worries as there is a home button on there to guide the user back to safety.
